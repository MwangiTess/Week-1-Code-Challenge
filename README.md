1. Project Title: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
2. Project Description.
    Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

    A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

3. Project Setup.
    I create the following deliverables: gradeGenerator(), which has two variables value and total.
    Using the if....else if, I was able to create code block conditions, that generates different grades dependiong on the marks.


1. Project Title: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
2. Project Description. 
    Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

    For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.


3. Project Setup. 
    I create the following deliverables: checkSpeedDetector(), which has one variable speed.
    For the first challenge I used if command to retun "OK" for speed less than 70.
    For the second challenge I used if....else if to return the demerit points and print “License suspended”


1. Project Title: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
2. Project Description.
    Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.

    NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

3. Project Setup. 
     Setting up the net salary calculator, I declared three differnt fuctions to calculate the Paye,Nhif and Nssf. Net salary is gotten after the basic salary has undergone all the deductions and benefits.
     Net salary calculator function  then incorporated the different functions to get the net salary.
